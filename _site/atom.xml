   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first post on this site so this should be a welcoming one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied Computer Engineering for 4 years and have been working on a software company as a Software Engineer since 2014. In this blog I will talk about technologies, frameworks I learnt, I want to learn and how things should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created this blog to be able to look up the solutions I came up with to a specific problems I faced, to remember how I installed softwares I used and what tools I used to solve general problems. Basically this blog is going to consist of the documentation of things I have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first goal about this blog is writing posts for technologies, frameworks etc. I learnt in the past six years. This includes Java, Maven, Git, SVN, Hadoop, MongoDB, HBase, Python etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope my posts helps you as much as they helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
