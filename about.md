Hello, I am Duygu. I am a Computer Engineer. I studied Computer Engineering at <a href="http://gazi.edu.tr/?language=en_US" target="_blank">Gazi University</a> from 2010 to 2014. I have been working at <a href="http://mantis.com.tr/en/" target="_blank">Mantis Software</a> since 2014. I have worked on a topic specific influence analysis on twitter users which can be seen <a href="http://anliksecim.com/sosyal-medya-etkili-kisiler" target="_blank">here</a>. In the last two years I mostly used Java, Hadoop, MongoDB and Nutch in the projects I have worked on.

I am interested in Data Mining, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
